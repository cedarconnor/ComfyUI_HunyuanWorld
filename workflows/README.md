## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. ComfyUI installed and running
2. HunyuanWorld models downloaded to `models/hunyuan_world/`
3. Sufficient VRAM (8GB+ recommended for high-quality generation)

### Quick Start
1. Open ComfyUI in your browser
2. Load any workflow template using "Load" button
3. Adjust prompts and settings as needed
4. Click "Queue Prompt" to start generation
5. Monitor progress in the UI
6. Find exported files in the `output/` directory

### Model Requirements
Each workflow requires specific HunyuanWorld model components:
- **text_to_panorama**: For generating panoramic images from text
- **scene_generator**: For depth estimation and semantic segmentation  
- **world_reconstructor**: For 3D mesh generation

Make sure all required models are available before running workflows.

### Performance Tips
- Start with lower resolutions (512x256) for testing
- Use fp16 precision to save VRAM
- Enable model caching for batch processing
- Monitor GPU memory usage during generation

## Customization Guide

### Modifying Prompts
- Edit text in `HunyuanTextInput` nodes
- Adjust `HunyuanPromptProcessor` settings for different styles
- Use negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements

### Quality vs Speed Trade-offs
- **Higher Quality**: More inference steps, higher resolutions, fp32 precision
- **Faster Generation**: Fewer steps, lower resolutions, fp16 precision
- **Balanced**: 30-50 steps, 1024x512 resolution, fp16 precision

### Export Formats
- **OBJ**: Widely supported, good for editing
- **PLY**: Simple geometry, smaller files
- **GLB**: Modern standard, includes materials
- **FBX**: Animation support, professional tools

### Memory Optimization
- Use smaller batch sizes if running out of VRAM
- Unload unused models between different workflow stages
- Consider using CPU for less critical operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Out of Memory**: Reduce resolution, batch size, or use fp16 precision
2. **Model Not Found**: Check model paths in `HunyuanLoader` nodes
3. **Slow Generation**: Reduce inference steps or resolution
4. **Export Failures**: Check output directory permissions

### Performance Monitoring
- Use Task Manager/Activity Monitor to watch VRAM usage
- Monitor ComfyUI console for error messages
- Check generated files for quality issues

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Node Combinations
You can mix and match nodes from different workflows:
- Use image input with text enhancement
- Combine multiple panoramas before 3D generation
- Add custom post-processing nodes

### Integration with Other Nodes
HunyuanWorld nodes work well with standard ComfyUI nodes:
- Image preprocessing nodes
- Upscaling nodes for higher quality
- Video generation for animated worlds

### Workflow Optimization
- Cache loaded models across different generations
- Use workflow groups to organize complex pipelines
- Save frequently used configurations as presets
